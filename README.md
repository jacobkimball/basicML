# basicML

A series of jupyter notebooks for exploring some basic concepts and algorithms for machine learning. 

The Linear Regression notebook covers Ordinary Least Squares, teaching the basics of standardization and feature importance, as well as evaluating regression models. 

The Classification Basics notebook uses Support Vector Machines with rbf kernel to teach the basics of cross validation, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating classification models. 

Classifying JIA helps you practice machine learning skills with some data from the Inan Research Lab at Georgia Tech, with some challenges to try out at the end. Special consideration is given to machine learning topics particular to working with biomedical data.  

I would recommend going through the Linear Regression notebook first, then Classification Basics, then Classifying JIA. 

If you are new to programming in Python, consider opening these notebooks through Google Colab. Here's a tutorial on how to do this:
